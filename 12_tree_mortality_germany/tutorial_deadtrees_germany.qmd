## Tutorial on dead trees in Germany

We will analyze the distribution of standing deadwood in Germany.

## Standing dead trees between 2018 and 2022

We have prepared a raster stack of the dead trees product. Each band represents one year from 2018 to 2020. The resolution is down-sampled to 100 meters. The extent of the data set is Germany.

Set working directory

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: true
#| warning: false
#library(here)

#install.packages(c("randomForest", "ggcorrplot"))
library(terra)
library(randomForest)
library(ggplot2)
library(ggcorrplot)
library(dplyr)

#here::here()
#getwd()

```

Loading the raster files and start exploring the data with some plotting

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: true
#| warning: false
library(terra)

# Specify the folder containing the raster files
folder = "Deadtrees"

# List all raster files in the folder (e.g., .tif files)
raster_files = list.files(folder, pattern = "\\.tif$", full.names = TRUE)

# Load and stack the rasters
raster_stack = rast(raster_files)


plot(raster_stack)
```

So where did the most trees die in this 5-year period? Lets find the hot-spots for tree mortality. Feel free to optimize the map, e.g. change the color ramp and breaks or make a whole new map.

```{r}
# Calculate the maximum value for each pixel
max_raster = app(raster_stack, fun = max, na.rm = TRUE)


# Define a custom color ramp
color_ramp = colorRampPalette(c("white", "orange", "red", "darkred"))

# Create breaks to emphasize values above 5000
breaks = c(0, 1000, 2000, 3000, 4000, 5000, 6000, 7000, 8000, 10000)

plot(max_raster, 
     col = color_ramp(length(breaks) - 1), 
     breaks = breaks, 
     main = "Maximum Value Raster with Custom Color Ramp")

# Customize the legend manually if needed
legend("topright", 
       legend = c("Low", "5000", "High"), 
       fill = color_ramp(3), 
       title = "Elevation (m)")
```

The values are in % dead trees per pixel, code as integer values from 1-1000 for better data handling and faster calculations. However, for the human mind %-values are much easier to understand. So please make a plot with %-Values (1 = 0.01% and 10000 = 100%).

```{r}
#nice plotting with %-values
```

Now we have and indication where most of the trees died.

## Mortality of tree species

Next we can analyze which tree species were most affected. To do so we need another map from the Thünen Institute, representing the most common tree species per pixel. We also down sampled to 100 meters. However, to process all trees species with varying thresholds at once would take too much time. So we are doing this for one species after another: Pick a species and run the calculations below with different thresholds.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| message: true
#| warning: false

# Load the raster stack and tree species raster
deadwood_stack = raster_stack
tree_species = rast("tree_species_class.tif")

#2 Birch
#3 Beech
#4 Douglas Fir
#5 Oak
#6 Alder
#8 Spruce
#9 Pine
#10 Larch
#14 Fir
#16 ODH
#17 ODL

#set species id here 
species_id = 8

# Normalize deadwood values (convert to 0-1 scale)
deadwood_stack = deadwood_stack / 10000

# Set the threshold for a dead pixel here 
# As the used data was resampled its is not possible to reproduce the exact same results from the paper
dead_trees_stack = deadwood_stack >= 0.35

# Convert logical TRUE/FALSE to integer 1/0 (optional)
dead_trees_stack = dead_trees_stack * 1

# Specify the years corresponding to the raster layers
years = c(2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022)  

# Initialize a result data frame to store the results
results = data.frame(Year = integer(), TreeSpecies = integer(), AreaDeadTrees = numeric(), AreaTreesSpecies = numeric())


# Loop through each raster (year) in the stack
for (i in 1:nlyr(deadwood_stack)) {
  # Extract the raster for the current year
  deadwood_year = dead_trees_stack[[i]]
  year = years[i]  # Get the corresponding year
  
  # Mask pixels belonging to the current species
  species_mask = tree_species == species_id
  
  # Calculate total and average deadwood proportion for the current species
  species_total_deadwood = global(deadwood_year * species_mask, fun = "sum", na.rm = TRUE)
  species_pixel_count = global(species_mask, fun = "sum", na.rm = TRUE)
  
  # Add result to the data frame
  results = rbind(
    results,
    data.frame(Year = year, TreeSpecies = species_id, AreaDeadTrees = species_total_deadwood$sum, AreaTreesSpecies = species_pixel_count$sum)
  )
}
# Calculate percentage share
results$share = results$AreaDeadTrees / results$AreaTreesSpecies * 100

head(results)

```

### Plotting deadwood percentage over time

```{r}
library(ggplot2)

ggplot(results, aes(x = Year, y = share)) +
  geom_line(color = "#008080", size = 1) +    # Line style
  geom_point(color = "darkgreen", size = 3) +    # Points on the line
  theme_minimal() +
  labs(title = "Deadwood Percentage Over Time",
       x = "Year",
       y = "Deadwood Percentage (%)") +
  theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
```

## Connecting tree mortality with some climatic and topographic data

Lets check if we can model the relationship between environmental data and tree-mortality. We have selected environemntal data, consisting of

-    [SRTM](https://www.earthdata.nasa.gov/data/instruments/srtm) (NASA space shuttle topography mission)

-   [Worldclim](https://www.worldclim.org/data/index.html)

-   [SoilGrids](https://soilgrids.org/)

What will we do?

1.  Prepare the data for model training (merge data into a common raster stack).

2.  Extract sample data from both the tree mortality map (response variable) and the climate data (predictors).

3.  Train a Random Forest model and evaluate the importance of the predictors.

### 1. Prepare Your Data

```{r}
#| message: true
#| warning: true

library(terra)

# Maximum mortality map (response variable)
max_mortality_map = max_raster  # Maximum mortality map from the dead trees stack

# Specify the folder containing the raster files of the predictors
folder_preds = "Predictors"

# List all raster files of the predictors in the folder (e.g., .tif files)
raster_files_preds = list.files(folder_preds, pattern = "\\.tif$", full.names = TRUE)

# Load and stack the rasters
preds_raster_stack = rast(raster_files_preds)
```

```{r}
# Check extent
ext(preds_raster_stack)
ext(max_raster)

# Check resolution
res(preds_raster_stack)
res(max_raster)

```

### 2. Sample predictor and response values

```{r}
# combine predictors (environmental variables) and response (tree mortality)
stack_updated = c(preds_raster_stack, max_raster)

# Extract values for the response (tree mortality)
sampled_values = spatSample(stack_updated, size = 5000, method = "random", xy = TRUE, na.rm=TRUE)

# Check the sampled values
head(sampled_values)
```

```{r}
plot(max_raster)
points(sampled_values$x, sampled_values$y, col = "red", pch = 18, cex = 0.5)
```

### 3. Train a Random Forest Model

What is a [RandomForest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_forest#:~:text=Random%20forests%20are%20a%20way,performance%20in%20the%20final%20model.)? RandomForest is a machine learning model. Its underlying principle is simple; it builds on decision trees. Each branch of a tree is a decision based on a predictor (e.g. a temperature value from WorldClim or Slope from SRTM). After one branch follows another branch with a subsequent decision. The special thing about randomForest is that it creates hundreds of such trees, selects the best ones and averages there result. This "democratic" majority vote makes this method so robust and its simplicity makes it so efficient. This is why for years, randomForest is one of the most effective machine learning methods for tabular data.

![](images/Sample-random-forest-regression-tree.png)

Lets train a randomForest. We will train the model a few times and check if the results (explained variance, importance of the predictors) change. Why may this happen? What influence has the sample size? You could also check the correlation between the predictors and remove one if the it exceeds 0.7.

```{r}
#library(randomForest)

# Define the response variable (tree mortality) and predictors (climate data)
response = sampled_values$max

# remove uncessesary variables (e.g. the x and y location)
head(sampled_values[, -c(1,2,11)])
predictors = sampled_values[, -c(1,2,11)]  # All columns except the first one (response variable)

# Train the Random Forest model
# What does the argument ntree? Read the help.
rf_model = randomForest(x = predictors, y = response, importance = TRUE, ntree = 500)

# Check the model results
print(rf_model)

```

You could also check the correlation between the predictors and remove one if the it exceeds +-0.7.

Further details on the WorldClim data (bio\_.\*) is available [here](https://www.worldclim.org/data/bioclim.html).

```{r}
#library(ggcorrplot)

# Visualize the correlation matrix

head(sampled_values[, -c(1,2,11)])
predictors = sampled_values[, -c(1,2,11)]  # All columns except the first one (response variable)

cor_matrix = cor(predictors, use = "complete.obs")
cor_matrix

ggcorrplot(cor_matrix, lab = TRUE)


```

### Permutation Test

In a Random Forest importance plot, %IncMSE (Percentage Increase in Mean Squared Error) is a measure of variable importance. It quantifies how much worse the model's predictions become (in terms of Mean Squared Error, MSE) when the values of a specific predictor variable are randomly permuted.

During the calculation of variable importance, the values of a predictor variable are permuted (shuffled randomly) across all observations, breaking the relationship between the predictor and the response.

IncNodePurity (Increase in Node Purity) is another measure of variable importance used in Random Forest models. It is based on the improvement in the model's ability to correctly classify or predict data (purity) that results from splitting a decision tree using a specific variable.

```{r}
varImpPlot(rf_model , sort = TRUE  , main = "Predictor Importance" )
```

### Permutation test advanced

The following procedure applies multiple permutation tests, to assess the stability of the predictor-response relationship. In other words: Are the results stable if we run them multiple times?\
Warning: This code will need several minutes (\~1 min \* interation).

If the code needs too long on your computer, you can load reprocessed data below the loop-section.

```{r}

# Parameters
n_iterations = 5 # Number of random samples
sample_size = 1000

# Store importance values
importance_results <- list()

# Loop to calculate variable importance
set.seed(42) # For reproducibility
for (i in 1:n_iterations) {
  # Create a random sample of the data
  sampled_data = spatSample(stack_updated, size = sample_size, method = "random", xy = TRUE, na.rm=TRUE)
  
  response = sampled_values$max

  predictors = sampled_values[, -c(1,2,11)]  # All columns except the first one (response variable)
  
  # Train Random Forest
  rf_model_it = randomForest(x = predictors, y = response, importance = TRUE)
  
  # Extract %IncMSE importance values
  importance_df = as.data.frame(importance(rf_model_it, type = 1)) # Type 1 for %IncMSE
  importance_df$Predictor = rownames(importance_df)
  importance_df$Iteration = i
  
  # Store the results
  importance_results[[i]] = importance_df
}

# Combine all importance values into a single data frame
all_importance = do.call(rbind, importance_results)

# Aggregate the importance values (mean and standard deviation)
importance_summary = all_importance %>%
  group_by(Predictor) %>%
  summarise(
    Mean_IncMSE = mean(`%IncMSE`),
    SD_IncMSE = sd(`%IncMSE`)
  )

# Load pre-processed data
#importance_summary = readRDS("results_importance.rds")

# Plot the results
ggplot(importance_summary, aes(x = reorder(Predictor, Mean_IncMSE), y = Mean_IncMSE)) +
  geom_point(size = 3, color = "darkblue") + 
  geom_errorbar(aes(ymin = Mean_IncMSE - SD_IncMSE, ymax = Mean_IncMSE + SD_IncMSE), width = 0.2) +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "%IncMSE Variable Importance",
    x = "Predictors",
    y = "Mean %IncMSE ± SD"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```

### Evaluate the dependencies of individual predictors to response

Next, we can calculate the effect of each predictor on the mortality. In easy words, the effect of a single variable is calculated based on its effect on the prediction.

#### Slope

The response is given in the original values (1-10000). Divide by 100 for %-values

```{r}
# Evaluate the predictors effects
partialPlot(rf_model, predictors, "slope", "1",xlab="Slope in Degree", ylab="Avg. Response",lwd=4,col="red") 
```

#### Soil: Sand 100-200 cm

The response is given in the original values (1-10000). Divide by 100 for %-values

```{r}
# Evaluate the predictors effects
partialPlot(rf_model, predictors, "sand_100-200cm_mean", "1",xlab="Sand 100-200 cm", ylab="Avg. Response",lwd=4,col="red") 
```

#### Soil: Clay 60-100 cm

The response is given in the original values (1-10000). Divide by 100 for %-values

```{r}
# Evaluate the predictors effects
partialPlot(rf_model, predictors, "clay_60-100cm_mean", "1",xlab="Clay 60-100 cm", ylab="Avg. Response",lwd=4,col="red") 
```

#### Precipitation Seasonality (wc2.1_30s_bio_15)

```{r}
# Evaluate the predictors effects
partialPlot(rf_model, predictors, "wc2.1_30s_bio_15" , "1",xlab="Precipitation Seasonality (CoV)", ylab="Avg. Response",lwd=4,col="red") 
```

#### Annual Mean Temperature (wc2.1_30s_bio_1)

```{r}
# Evaluate the predictors effects
partialPlot(rf_model, predictors, "wc2.1_30s_bio_1", "1",xlab="Annual Mean Temperature", ylab="Avg. Response",lwd=4,col="red") 
```

#### Annual Precipitation (wc2.1_30s_bio_12)

```{r}
# Evaluate the predictors effects
partialPlot(rf_model, predictors, "wc2.1_30s_bio_12" , "1",xlab="Annual Precipitation", ylab="Avg. Response",lwd=4,col="red") 
```

#### Precipitation of Driest Quarter (wc2.1_30s_bio_17)

```{r}
# Evaluate the predictors effects
partialPlot(rf_model, predictors, "wc2.1_30s_bio_17" , "1",xlab="Precipitation of Driest Quarter", ylab="Avg. Response",lwd=4,col="red") 
```
